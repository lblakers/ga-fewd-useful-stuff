# Your Task

Write a function that compares two numbers and displays the result on the page.  The numbers are in the input fields with the ids a and b.

At this point there is nowhere to put the results so you will need to fix this by either writing some markup with an appropiate style or use the good old fashioned JavaScript alert function http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_popup.asp to display the result.
